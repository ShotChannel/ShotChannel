Beautiful, right?

Looking at my desktop today, I still cannot believe that 6 months ago (March 2025), I was still struggling and scared to open my laptop's BIOS. The best I could do at "ricing" my Windows 11 was installing Windhawk, Rainmeter and Wallpaper Engine (Horrible performance, of course).

The day I made my first bootable USB and installed Fedora Linux 42 (KDE Plasma) into my poor laptop has changed my life. In a good way. And nowadays, I feel proud enough (I do not mean I'm good enough) to make a GitHub account and share my ricing process here.

*(I am still a newbie, so please be easy on me :) I will make my own code in the near future, and I guarantee you it will be absolute dogshit!! :proud:)*

## ❓Anyways, Q&A !!

> *(Or, I question and answer myself because literally no one cares about this...)*

`1. Are you really into coding?`
   
**>> No, I'm not :) I am more into graphic design. Honestly, if I were never using Linux, I would never do all of these.**

`2. Why did you choose Fedora Linux as your current distro?`

**>> I asked a friend on Discord, and he just randomly picked me one of the famous distros, which is Fedora (lol).**\
**The funny thing is, after I've used Fedora for a while, I did a test on [Distro Chooser](distrochooser.de), and after the test, the no.1 distro recommendation was Fedora!**\
**It's like *fate* has already chosen the distro for me. And I absolutely love it.**

`3. Why did you choose KDE Plasma as your current Desktop Environment (DE)?`

**>> I do acknowledge the flexibility of the Window Manager (WM), but KDE Plasma has already done 99% of the things that I need and can be done in a WM. For example, the Plasma panel with the [Plasma Panel Colorizer widget](https://github.com/luisbocanegra/plasma-panel-colorizer) is a very good alternative to [Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar?tab=readme-ov-file); or the script [Krohnkite](https://github.com/esjeon/krohnkite) can make KDE Plasma a tiling desktop like Hyprland or i3.**\
**It's not an exaggeration to say that using KDE Plasma is the closest experience to using a WM.**

`4. Gam-`
